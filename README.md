# First_JavaScript_Project

1- create a file and name it 'app.js' and type "Hello World" 5 times 
2- run the file from your CLI by using this command node app.js
3- Declare a variable z and assign the number 7.25 to it.
4- Write a console.log statement in which you log the value of z.
5- Declare another variable a that has the value of z but rounded to the nearest integer.
6- Write a console.log statement in which you log the value of a.
7- So now we have z and a find a way to compare the two values and store the highest of the two in a new variable.
8- Write a console.log statement in which you log the value of the highest value.
9- Declare variable and assign to it an empty array. don't forget to make your variable name indicates that it contains more than 1 element like [items, players] instead of [item, player]
10- Write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of the array is.
11- Write a console.log statement that logs the array content into your console.
12- Create a new variable with an array that has 3 of your favorite fruits, each in a different string. Make sure the name of the variables says something about what the variable contains.
13- Declare 4 variables: 2 must be strings and 2 must be objects
14- Create 6 conditional statements, where for each you check if the data type of one variable is the same as the other
15- Find out how to check the type of a variable
16- Write 2 console.log statements to log the type of 2 variables, each with a different data type
17- Now compare the types of your different variables with one another
18- Log [They are not same...] when the types are different
19- Declare 2 variables, that each hold an array. The first array should have 4 items, the second 7 items
20- Find out how to get the length of each array. Write a console.log statement that shows the length of each array
21- Remove the comma from this string "Hi,I,am,really,happy,to,learn,new,skills,related,to,javascript"
22- Add it to your file and log the output to your console
23- Find a way to remove the commas from the string and replace them with spaces.
24- Create a for loop, that iterates from 0 to 25
25- Create a conditional statement that checks if the value of the counter variable is odd or even
26- If it's odd, log to the console The number [PUT_NUMBER_HERE] is odd!.
27- If it's even, log to the console The number [PUT_NUMBER_HERE] is even!.
28- Declare a variable that contains an empty object with a clear name
29- Give the object 5 properties [name, age, study, zipcode, address], don't forget to make [address] contains more than one attribute 
30- log each property out separately, using a loop (for, while or do/while)
31- Declare a variable that holds an array of 3 objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (string), author (string), and alreadyRead (boolean indicating if you read it yet).
32- Loop through the array of books.
33- For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "Game Of Thrones by J.R.R. Martin".
34- Create a conditional statement to change the log depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like You already read "The Hobbit" right after the log of the book details
35- If you haven't read it log a string like You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings"
36- create an array with name [listOfPlayers] and add to it three players from the start of the array and two from the end
37- remove 2 players
38- add from the start alos two players 
39- split the array to two arrays and try to add new player to the second array then concatenate them then log the result to the console 
40- iterate the array by using (for of and general for "the old way" )
